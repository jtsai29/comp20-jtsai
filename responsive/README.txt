I was able to correctly implement the shifting image
functionality based on the width of the browser window.
I accomplished this by setting the background image to
the homer.jpg image and then setting the display para-
meters to be the width and height of one scene in the
image. Then, I shifted the image to display a different
section by checking the browser width. Since this is
the only functionality for this file, nothing was
implemented incorrectly.

I did not collaborate or discuss with anyone on this 
assignment, and I spent about 1.5 hours on this assign-
ment.
