Lab 5
README

I was able to correctly display the duckhunt background and
both of the ducks at roughly similar positions as the given
example image. This was all implemented by using JavaScript
to display the images on the canvas of the index.html file.
Nothing was incorrectly implemented in this lab.

I have not collaborated or discussed this lab with anyone.

I spent approximately 1 hour on this lab.
