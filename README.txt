The purpose of this Git repository is to have an easily accessible place to 
store all of my assignments and be able to work incrementally off of. If at 
any time I want to go back to a previous version, then I can do that because 
of this Git repository. It is also a convenient way for the instructor to 
access my work.

My favorite lab was the Duck Hunt lab because I love playing video games and 
being able to do something related to that was really fun for me. I was 
really excited once Ming played the Duck Hunt music in class to introduce 
the lab to us, and even though the assignment was just placing the ducks 
onto the background, I really enjoyed doing some work related to something 
I love.

In terms of web programming, I would say I have improved a whole lot because 
I really knew next to nothing about HTML and everything. Although I had taken 
programming classes before, this course was still very different and required 
its own unique approach. It definitely has helped me become more aware of how 
the web works and how to approach it.

I think the most important thing I have learned from this course is how much 
we need to rely on other entities for carrying out tasks. For example, in the 
MapChat assignment, we needed to use the Google Maps API and learn how to work 
with that to display markers on the map. We also needed to send and retrieve 
data from a server in order to get all of the marker information, so that 
really emphasized to me how important it is to understand and know how to work 
with systems that are already in place. Also, the third assignment was very 
difficult and showed me how difficult creating the servers we use everyday 
is a daunting task. All of this has just made me more appreciative of the 
systems in place that help us carry out so many of our everyday functions.

Personally, I think I would like to understand more about how games work 
in relation to the web. I play a lot of games, and no small portion of them 
interact with the Internet in some way, so I would like to learn more about 
how all of that Internet interaction functionality works to help create the 
games that I play today.
