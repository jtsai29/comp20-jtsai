Assignment 4
README

The assignment is simply a report on the security issues of a
MapChat application and its server, so since there was no programming 
involved in this assignment, nothing particular needed to be implemented.
Only the display of the report page (index.html) was created along with 
its styling, and that works properly.

I received the code and access to the MapChat applications by Scott 
Bettigole, but I tested the application and completed the report by myself.

I spent approximately 4 hours on this assignment.
