	<h1>Security</h1>

	<h1>Introduction</h1>

	<p>The purpose of this report is to assess and analyze the security 
	in two products created by SBettigole. The first product, titled 
	MapChat, displays on a Google Map all of the user checkins found in
	a database. This database is contained in the second product, which
	is a server-side application which handles the insertion of new user
	checkins and retrieval of checkin data. The MapChat product first
	determines the location of the user and then sends predetermined 
	user checkin information to be stored in the database. Afterwards,
	the database returns all of the user checkins which are used to 
	display all of the users in their corresponding locations on the map.
	</p>
	<p>This report will detail any security related issues of the two
	products which may impact the intended functionality or privacy in 
	terms of access for the products.
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<h1>Methodology</h1>

	<p>The applications were first tested with input formatted as intended 
	to ensure that the entire product works as intended for ideal input. 
	After this check, the applications were tested with non-ideal input, 
	such as JavaScript code being sent as the message of the user checkin. 
	This was performed using the curl tool to send checkin data directly 
	to the server database. The functionality of the program with this 
	non-ideal input was then observed. Additionally, a copy of the author's 
	own MapChat application was used to determine if it was allowed to access 
	the database server for SBettigole's application.
	</p>

	<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
	<p>The server does not reject JavaScript code being given in the message field 
	of the checkin, which allows for Cross-Site Scripting. This occurs in two 
	places: the / GET page of the server app, and the MapChat map page. The server 
	is also accessible by websites from different domains, so the data in the 
	database can easily be accessed and tampered with by anyone.
	</p>

	<h1>Issues Found</h1>

	<h2>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>
	<h3>Location: / GET page of Server Application</h3>
	<h3>Severity: High</h3>
	<p>Cross-site scripting is a serious problem because it affects pretty much 
	every user that visits the page. If a user had sent in JavaScript code to be 
	stored in the database, then when the page displays that data, the code 
	actually runs. This may lead to unwanted behavior such as redirecting to 
	another website.
	</p>
	<p>When visiting the / GET page of the server application for MapChat, all of 
	the checkins in the database are displayed on the page. However, if one of the 
	values of the checkin is JavaScript code or even HTML code, it will run when 
	the page tries to print it. This was found by intentionally entering HTML  
	code as the value for the message field of the checkin. The problem can be seen 
	in the screenshot below. The first image shows the insertion of the HTML code 
	data while the second screenshot shows the effect of the data on the web page 
	that displays it.

	<img src="xss_image.png" alt="XSS Image">
	<p>By checking the data to be inserted into the database for HTML code and 
	stripping it of special characters such as '<' and '>', this would remove any 
	functionality that it have produced if left unchanged. This will 
	ensure that code is not stored into the database as code and will not perform 
	any functions when displayed on a page.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>
	<h3>Location: MapChat Map Page</h3>
	<h3>Severity: High</h3>
	<p>As mentioned above, cross-site scripting can be problematic since it carries 
	out some functionality on a web page even if it was unintended. This may affect 
	the usability of the product.
	</p>
	<p>This issue was found by visiting the MapChat map page after having inserted 
	data containing HTML code into the server database. In this instance, the data 
	inserted had a message value of:
	<xmp><p style='color:blue'>I'm_really_feeling_it</p></xmp> 
	This caused the corresponding message of the checkin to display as blue text on 
	a new line. The code could have easily been JavaScript code meant for carrying 
	out some functionality unintended by the MapChat product. The effect of the 
	issue can be seen in the screenshot below.
	</p>
	<img src="map_image.png" alt="MapChat Issue">
	<p>To fix this issue, it is necessary to remove any HTML related characters 
	from data before inserting into the server. As long as this is taken care of, 
	then the data inserted into the database should not be able to function as 
	HTML code when displayed.
	</p>

	<h2>Access From Different Origin</h2>
	<h3>Location: /sendLocation POST API</h3>
	<h3>Severity: Medium</h3>
	<p>The server application can be accessed by websites from a different origin. 
	This means that other webpages can send and retrieve data from the database 
	even if they were not intended to. This is a vulnerability relating to the 
	privacy of the data which is easily accessible by outside sources. If the 
	data was particularly important, then this would be a sever problem.
	</p>
 	<p>By examining the server application, it was discovered that there was no 
	restriction on which websites could access it. So, a copy of the author's 
	MapChat application was used to see if it could send and receive data from 
	the server. It was able to interact with the same server because the markers 
	displayed on the map were the same as those from SBettigole's MapChat. This 
	can be seen in the image below.
	</p>
	<img src="mapchat_copy_access.png" alt="Alternative MapChat Access">
	<p>This problem could be resolved by only allowing specific websites to have 
	access to the server and be able to interact with it. This may mean 
	that it is harder to use the server, but it should only be used for the 
	specific applications that need it.
	</p>

	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
	<p>Although it works properly with correctly formatted input, the 
	MapChat application contains security problems that may severely 
	impact the usability of the product. One of the major problems is Cross-Site 
	scripting (XSS), but this can easily be fixed by simply checking and removing 
	HTML related characters from data before inserting into the server. One other 
	significant problem, being able to access and interact with the server from a 
	different origin, can be fixed by specifying individual websites to have 
	access. The costs associated with these fixes are quite minimal since they 
	only require some modifications to the code running these products. In general, 
	it is important to prevent and handle these issues because they may hinder the 
	functionality of the product.
