	<h1>Security</h1>

	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this report is to assess and analyze the security 
	in two products created by SBettigole. The first product, titled 
	MapChat, displays on a Google Map all of the user checkins found in
	a database. This database is contained in the second product, which
	is a server-side application which handles the insertion of new user
	checkins and retrieval of checkin data. The MapChat product first
	determines the location of the user and then sends predetermined 
	user checkin information to be stored in the database. Afterwards,
	the database returns all of the user checkins which are used to 
	display all of the users in their corresponding locations on the map.
	</p>
	<p>This report will detail any security related issues of the two
	products which may impact the intended functionality or privacy in 
	terms of access for the products.
	</p>

	<h1>Methodology</h1>
	<p>The applications were first tested with input formatted as intended 
	to ensure that the entire product works as intended for ideal input. 
	After this check, the applications were tested with non-ideal input, 
	such as JavaScript code being sent as the message of the user checkin. 
	This was performed using the curl tool to send checkin data directly 
	to the server database. The functionality of the program with this 
	non-ideal input was observed. 
	</p>

	<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>

	<hr/>

	<h1>Issues Found</h1>
	<p>For correctly formatted input, there is no error returned by the server 
	and the data is stored into the database. (This may not be a security error, 
	but on the main / GET page of the server application, the displayed checkins 
	are not in chronological order.) Also, it correctly rejects the given data 
	if at least one of the required fields (login, lat, lng, message) is missing. 
	
	</p>

	<p>When one of the input fields is missing a value (for example, latitude 
	is specified as "lat="), except for login, the data is still accepted by 
	the database. In the case of latitude, when displaying on the MapChat page, 
	the marker associated with the incorrect input appears to use the value 0 
	for the latitude even though it was not provided.
	</p>
	<p>Also, the server does not check if the given latitude and longitude values 
	are numbers. They can be given as alphabetic text and are accepted into the 
	database. This is incorrect data that should not have been accepted, but 
	when accessing the MapChat page, this checkin does not appear. 
	
	<p>One important security issue is that HTML can be given in the message 
	value, and it will not be rejected by the server. So, as an example, the 
	message value for a checkin was 
	<xmp><p style='color:blue'>I'm_really_feeling_it</p></xmp> 
	This made it so that when the message was displayed, it appeared as blue text 
	and created a new line as well. 
	</p>

	<p>The server also will still accept any checkin with all of the required 
	fields but even if they contain additional fields. The checkin will still 
	display on the map properly assuming that the required fields have correct 
	values, but the additional fields will unnecessarily occupy space on the 
	server.
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
	<p>Although it works properly with correctly formatted input, the 
	MapChat application contains security problems that may severely 
	impact the usability of the product.
