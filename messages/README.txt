All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented, including
the display of the JSON data on the webpage using each object's
content and username. Nothing was incorrectly implemented.

I have not collaborated or discussed this assignment with anyone.

I spent about 1.5 hours on this assignment.

It is not possible to request data from a different origin. This is
for security reasons because if it were possible to get data from
a different origin, then a malicious source could modify and possibly
delete data from many different sources. That would make it extremely
easy for one's data and information to be stolen, so the same-origin
policy is necessary to prevent this. It keeps people's data safe from
unwanted access by others.
